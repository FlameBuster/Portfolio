      <p>
        Hello! I'm Akul S Rajeevan, a passionate web developer from India.
        Growing up in a defense family, I've had the unique opportunity to
        travel across India, spending much of my life in the northern regions.
        My journey into technology was sparked by my love for gaming, which
        ignited a deep interest in creating interactive and dynamic web
        experiences. I specialize in Web Development and have a keen interest in
        Artificial Intelligence. My curiosity drives me to learn new
        technologies quickly and efficiently, and I find immense satisfaction in
        seeing my creations come to life. When I'm not coding, you'll find me on
        the basketball court or playing badminton. I'm an athletic person who
        enjoys gymming and staying active. I'm excited to connect with
        like-minded individuals and contribute to innovative projects that make
        a difference..
